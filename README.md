# Recreational Programming

Here you can find collection of different problems or mini-projects made by me. In general, I treat this repository as "instagram-stories" where people post pictures that they want to post, but they are not good enough to have a separate post.
Similarly, here I am posting code, that either too simple, or too short (or both). Each  mini-project and problem was implemented in less than 2 hours(in some cases even less than 1 hour).
